Steps in a Machine Learning Project (AI):
    1 - Gathering data to load into program
    2 - Editing the data to the AI's needs
    3 - Analysing the data to define the input and output columns to delete the rest
    4 - Creating seperate dataframes for inputs and outputs
    5 - Splitting up the data into testing and training data
    6 - Selecting the machine learning algorithm and perforn the training of the model
    7 - Performing predictions and comparing them with actual results to calculate accuracy

Types of Machine Learning (AI): 
    1 - Supervised Learning:
       Training the model under supervison. It has labelled data. Face of the person in openCV course.

    2 - Unsupervised Learning:
       No labelled data. System will learn with the pattern / similarities and try to group it.

    3 - Reinforcement Learning:
        Making mistakes and learning. Hit ad trial method.
